### What is GoodWire?
<p>
GoodWire is an online ecommerce platform apart of a semester-long group coding project. 
The goal of this project was to effectively plan the design of the system before final implementation. This involved the design and determination of:
<ul>
  <li>Goal and Sub-goals</li>
  <li>Requirement Analysis</li>
  <li>Scenario Based Theories</li>
  <li>Use-Case Diagrams</li>
  <li>Sequence and Activity Diagrams</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The final description of our project was determined to be: <br><i> "GoodWire is an online shop for technology devices. Customers can purchase new or refurbished products using our simple, easy-to-use web interface. With the ambition of making an impact on the world; GoodWire is dedicated to ensuring our customer's needs are met to the highest standard."</i>
